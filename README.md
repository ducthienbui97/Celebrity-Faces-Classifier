# Celebrity Faces Classifier

I use keras with CNTK back end to train a model class 88 celebrities with the data from [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/msra-cfw-data-set-of-celebrity-faces-on-the-web/)

Due to a limited computing resources, my model's accuracy is very low ~ 40% - 50%.
